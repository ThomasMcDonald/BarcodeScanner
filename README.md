the barcode scanner returns coordinates when it finds a barcode, would be real cool if i could add an overlay to the barcode

make own barcode component
barcode camera needs to full screen
when clicking the list item you get a modal with barcode preview and all data 
	with delete and edit
	only let the user edit the title of the QR code, defauilt to 'QR CODE'
